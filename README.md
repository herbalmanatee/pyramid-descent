Hi, thank you for this opportunity to showcase my problem solving abilities.

To run this code :

 1. Clone repo to local machine
 2. run command npm i to install dependencies (jest)
 3. run command npm run test to run the test suite

I look forward to learning more about the company and the problems you have to solve!

Best,
William Eliason
